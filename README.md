# series.ini

A project started by PaolinoF15 and maintained by Xain D'Sleena (since version 0.143); from 0.144 updated by AntoPISA.
Thanks to http://www.arcade-history.com/. From 0.162 version, the file deals only for arcade sets.
From the 0.177 version it is helped by a tool for the creation and verification of the .ini files, created by motoschifo.
